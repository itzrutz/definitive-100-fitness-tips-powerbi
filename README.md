# 🏋️ The Definitive 100 Fitness Tips — Power BI Dashboard

An interactive Power BI dashboard that transforms 100 evidence-based fitness habits into a decision-support experience.  
Instead of static advice, users can filter, explore, and expand fitness tips based on difficulty, goals, and focus areas.
